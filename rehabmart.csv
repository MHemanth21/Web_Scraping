While this test is commonly done with a simple blood pressure cuff, the Dopplex DMX enhances test accuracy by providing waveforms, a visual representation of sound.

In many cases, Doppler sounds can be misleading, but the Dopplex DMX has improved sound quality with DDNR (Dynamic Digital Noise Reduction) technology which significantly reduces background hiss. This helps clinicians detect small vessels or calcified arteries that other dopplers simply cannot locate. Enhanced audio, waveform technology, and many other attributes such as storable data, make the Dopplex DMX ABI Kit the best ABI testing tool on the market.",,//image.rehabmart.com/include-mt/img-resize.asp?output=webp&path=/imagesfromrd/dmx-hands-probe-1920w.jpg&quality=80&newwidth=540,https://www.rehabmart.com/product/dopplex-dmx-ankle-brachial-index-abi-system-51663.html

Galvanic Stim Digital Electrotherapy Device by PMT,Electrotherapy,$284.07,$198.65,"The Galvanic Stim Digital Electrotherapy Device by Pain Management Technologies implements a specialized electrotherapy method to treat major tissue trauma, particularly in cases of bleeding and swelling. This unit provides High-Voltage Pulsed Galvanic Stimulation (HVPGS), which is a unique form of electrotherapy that's used for wound healing and relief of intense musculoskeletal pain. 

Unlike common electrotherapy methods such as TENS or IFC that use alternating current in treatment, Galvanic Current therapy uses direct current to create a small electrical field in the target region and stimulate fluid movement. The electrical field applied by the unit can be positive or negatively charged for different desired outcomes. The positive field pad creates an effect similar to an acutely-targeted ice pack, as it reduces circulation to the area to rapidly relieve swelling and decrease pain. The negative field pad, on the other hand, creates a zone of increased circulation and fluid movement, which helps to significantly increase the rate of healing in the target area. 

This dual application of HVPGS for specialized, targeted treatment of musculoskeletal pain makes the device an ideal tool for wound healing and relief from conditions characterized by intense musculoskeletal pain, such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Diabetic Foot. Additionally, the device can be invaluable for treatment of many common injuries, as it can reduce pain and promote increased healing, which makes it useful for athletes and people with highly active lifestyles.",,//image.rehabmart.com/include-mt/img-resize.asp?output=webp&path=/imagesfromrd/digi-galvanic-2.jpg&quality=80&newwidth=540,https://www.rehabmart.com/product/galvanic-stim-device-pmt-50198.html
